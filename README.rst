Markovian is an extremely simple Markov chain generator. You likely want to use something else like 'markov' or 'markovify'.

* Free software: ISC license
* Documentation: https://markovian.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* Give Markovian some text and it gives you back a chain that you can use to
  generate different, crazier text.

* Note that this is an example of README driven development, as to say that this
  project doesn't actually do anything at all yet. Good news though it's free!
